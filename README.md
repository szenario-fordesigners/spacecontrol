# SpaceControl

### Webspace Monitoring On Point.

SpaceControl was made to ensure you never run out of webspace. With its minimal interface the widget provides an easy
overview of the current webspace usage and displays a warning when it’s time for taking action.  
A few pixels on your Craft Dashboard, a big step for your website.
